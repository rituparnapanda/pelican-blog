:summary: Agile methodology is a vast concept, I am going to write what I
          have extracted from it.


We all have studied about various project development methodologies in school.
Waterfall was one of the primary and prefered development methodology at that
time and was purely used by almost all the companies. Now a days Agile has
replaced all the old development life cycles and companies prefer agile over
waterfall. I have worked with both kinds of projects and personally I would
prefer agile project development.

Agile is my prefered project development because the agile team focuses on
getting the minimum viable product (MVP) out first. Over the time the
product becomes stable with continuous end to end testing with end users.


I have few pros and cons listed down about agile development (these points may
not be true in every cases, the pros and cons is entirely based on my
experience with project development) :


Pros :
------

* Project development runs in warp speed : agile development is usually
  fast because team focus on small user stories and complete it in one or
  two sprint.
* No need of understanding complex business process in one go : every
  business have same goal (ie. being best at what they do) but works on
  different principles. It is not easy for development team to understand
  the entire process all in one and find a solution. Agile makes it easier
  for team members to focus into one small segments at a time.
* Customer works closely with development team and the feedback and
  suggestion loop becomes faster and continuous.


Cons :
------

* Most of the developers in the team are not aware of end goal of the project.
* The solution given to the customers is a copy of their requirement, which
  is sometimes not the right solution to their problems.
