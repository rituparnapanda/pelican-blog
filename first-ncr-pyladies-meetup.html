    <p>I was following Pyladies from quite a long time, and I was keen to start the
chapter here in India. Finally we could start one on our own. I am so
excited to announce that on June 14th, 2014 - 4 women (out of them 3 were
python developers) finally met for the first time at Noida for Pyladies Meetup.</p>
<p><em>Yay we made it</em> :-)</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>On our first Meetup, we discussed about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each others interest</li>
<li>Setting up a new project and Github repository</li>
<li>Introduction of virtual environment and Python</li>
<li>And agenda for next Meetup</li>
</ul>
<p>It was very exciting, meeting and talking about our challenges and issues.
I called some of my male colleagues to help us and they were very positive
and enthusiastic while helping us.</p>
<p>We planned to meet every month atleast once and learn coding together. If
anyone is interested, then please follow us on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/PyladiesIndia/">Meetup.com</a>
and know more about our upcoming meetup.</p>
